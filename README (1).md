# CHONKAGOTCHI

**Your Chonk is alive. Take care of it.**

A Tamagotchi-style virtual pet game for [Chonks](https://chonks.xyz) — the fully onchain PFP collection on Base.

A gift for Marka — from Flex ❤️

## Features

- 🍕 **Feed** your Chonk with 6 different foods, each with unique stat effects
- 🎮 **Play** with your Chonk to boost happiness (costs energy)
- ⭐ **Star Catcher** mini-game with high score tracking
- 🌙 **Sleep** mode to restore energy (stats decay while you're away!)
- 💕 **Pet** your Chonk by clicking on it
- 👒 **Dress** — choose from 7 different Chonks
- 📊 **Stats** — track age, feedings, plays, and high scores
- 💾 **Persistent** — your Chonk remembers its state between visits
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly** — works on any device
